# docker-registry-to-registry-sync

Tool for syncing docker images from one registry to another

## Goal

Make is possible to sync all tags of a number of docker repositories
from one registry to another. Can be useful if you have an interal docker
registry but want to sync a subset of the docker images to a globally 
accessibly registry.

## Usage

### Configuration

Create a `config.yml` file. Example:

```yaml
source_registry:
  url: https://docker.example.com
  verify_ssl: True
  username: some_user
  password: some_password

destination_registry:
  url: http://127.0.0.1:5000
  verify_ssl: True
  username: some_user
  password: some_password

all_repositories: True

repositories:
  - company/super-project
  - company/cool-project
```

The meaning of the settings:

* `source-registry`: The registry to sync from
* `destination-registry`: The registry to sync to
* `repositories`: A list of docker repositores, consisting of the repository name
  and image name (without the registry part).
  
When the images are synced, the registry part of the tag is replaced, e.g.
in the example above the tag `docker.example.com/company/super-project` is
re-tagged as `127.0.0.1:5000/company/super-project` and pushed to `127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Passwords as environment variables

You can specify the registry passwords using the `SOURCE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` 
and `DESTINATION_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` environment variables instead of 
including them in the `config.yml` file.

### Running via Docker:

```
docker run --rm -it \
    -v $(pwd)/config.yml:/config.yml \
    stefanhudelmaier/docker-registry-to-registry-sync
```

When using environment variables for the passwords:

```
docker run --rm -it \
    -e SOURCE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=secret \
    -e DESTINATION_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=secret \
    -v $(pwd)/config.yml:/config.yml \
    stefanhudelmaier/docker-registry-to-registry-sync
```

## Known limitations

* Does not work with Docker Hub due to a problem in the used registry client, see https://github.com/yodle/docker-registry-client/issues/42
